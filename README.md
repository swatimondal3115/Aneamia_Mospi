Anemia remains a major public health issue in India over the decades, disproportionately affecting women and Men. Despite efforts like Anemia Mukt Bharat, NFHS-5 reports show rising anemia rates across the country. Over 57% of women and 25% of men are anemic, highlighting persistent gender inequalities. While many national level studies exist (e.g., Pasricha et al., 2020), few have explored district-level variation in depth. This project fills that gap by using NFHS-5 data to analyze regional and gender-specific patterns in India.
